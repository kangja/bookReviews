## Overview

**bookReviews** is an online community of book reviews and ratings. Users could see a list of books with their authors, summaries, page numbers, genere, language, price, and etc, and read other people's reviews. But, users have to make accounts and be logged in to create, edit, and delete reviews and ratings.

## MVP

### Goals

### Server(Back End)
- Have a **RESTful JSON API**.
  - Build a **Ruby on Rails** server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
  - Build a database with at least 3 tables:
     - users, books, and reviews/comments tables.
  - Utilize **Rails** to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between your non-User tables 
    - Those users who made the account and are logged in can create, update, and delete reviews.
  - Authentication 

### Client (Front End) <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a working, interactive **React** app, built using `npx create-react-app`.
  - Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
  - Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
  - Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
  - Use _only_ React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from your **Ruby on Rails API**, and render that data in your components.
- Utilize **React Router**, for client-side routing.
- Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` ) on the front end.
    - Users can view all the book lists, descriptions, and reviews whether they are logged in or not.
    - Only those ssers who made the account and are logged in can create, update, and delete reviews.

### Styling

- Be styled with CSS (or SCSS, if you'd prefer).
- Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design.
- Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop).

### Linting 

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case` convention.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are okay).

### Deployment 

- Deploy the fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify.
- Deploy the back-end via Heroku.

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | Manages Front End |
|   React Router   | Is the process of resource navigation in a web app. This is how your app determines what to do with a client request. |
| Rails | Manages backend server. |
|     PostgreSQL   | Manages database. |
|  CSS             | Styling |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

[Desktop and Ipad Pro Wireframe Link] (https://whimsical.com/8NiA4PHQBfYT525G9ReY36)

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
